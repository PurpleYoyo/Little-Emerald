 - Their Pokémon have Hardy natures, no items (mostly), and level-up moves in Normal Mode.
*Note: All trainer Pokémon not in the Important Trainers documents have a Hardy nature and level-up moves.
Combee and Salandit are now always female.
Added Teddiursa-Bloodmoon, a new form with adjusted stats, the Mind's Eye ability, an added Ground type, and a separate learnet.
